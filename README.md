### Hi, I am John Lee. Welcome to my repositories ! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Statistics Lecturer at the University of Chicago. There, I designed a course on Data Science in Quantitative Finance and Risk Management and taught it to undergraduate students of all majors and backgrounds. What I enjoy most about teaching is that I am able to engage with students on both individual and team levels. My vision is to create a learning community for students to embrace uncertainty, obstruction, and frustration throughout their learning journey. 

I am also a Business Intelligence Developer in healthcare. My day-to-day tasks range from designing query models to capture clinical, regulatory, and business metrics to building visualization dashboards that reflect health equity patterns in hospital operations. I enjoy this field of work because I am able to communicate the technical facet of my work to field laymen. My goal is to novelize analytical tools to help multidisciplinary professionals and non-professionals make critical decisions in life.
