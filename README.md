### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate researcher at the University of Michigan. On the statistical side, my research revolves around predictions of rare events under the Bayesian statistical belief and implementations of spatial-temporal models on circumstantial loss events. A completed project involves model development to forecast worldwide economic recessions. On the financial side, my research stretches from analyzing corporate fundamentals to developing investment strategies to manage the existential risks. A completed project involves Enterprise Risk Management for Small Businesses. I am skilled in information retrieval and language recognition tactics in a web environment. A finished project includes mining Letters to Shareholders from the annual reports of the S&P 500 companies, followed by analyzing sentiments reflected by the Chief Executive Officer in each letter.
