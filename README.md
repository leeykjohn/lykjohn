### Hi, I am John. Welcome and feel free to check out my repositories ! ðŸ‘‹

I am a research assistant of statistics and finance at the University of Michigan. My expertise involves designing statistical learning algorithms to evaluate portfolio risks, econometric outcomes, and market microstructures. I have extensive experience in financial computation and risk management, particularly for the U.S. and foreign asset classes, including equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. One project of mine was to develop a client web application to evaluate the probabilities of extreme losses and identifying optimal portfolios under dynamic economic climates. One part of my work involves applying Machine Learning techniques such as regression and classification analyses to deploy trading algorithms with the goal of achieving adequate reward-to-risk control. Another part of my work is to develop financial education curriculums to promote the accessibility of financial knowledge and technology to underprivileged communities.
